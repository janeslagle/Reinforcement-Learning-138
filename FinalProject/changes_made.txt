Environment:
(1) renamed it to InfraPlanner so that we would have a consistent naming pattern across all our classes. Now it algins with DeepSARSA.py and SMDP.py.
(2) I changed the is_sdmp parameter input to be which_algorithm instead like we talked about over text

SMDP + DeepSARSA:
I only made changes to naming here, I didn't change anything with the code logic. I did this so that I could control running each algorithm from 
one function only in main.py! 
(1) I actually only changed the name of one parameter, I changed action_history to be called all_acts_taken instead. I just didn't like the name 
action_history for it.m

main:
Okay I made it easier to read from what I changed last night because that was totally whack and way too complicated, and I made it more based on the OG
main that we have which makes running it for each algorithm SUPER simple and SUPER easy now, yay!!!
So here's EXACTLY what I changed with it:
(1) I put the same exact plotting code in its own function so that I could call it super easily for each algorithm when printing out the results. 
The only changes I made with the code here were changing the colors of the plots and also adding which algorithm it's plotting for to the titles.
= plot_rewards function

(2) The agent_results function is the same as the agent_performance function that we originally had. The only difference is I print out a little more
detail for each original metric we had in agent_performance. BUT exact same, I just didn't like the name so renamed it and added a little more detail 
to the print statements

(3) NEW FUNCTION: run_each_algor
Thist just puts everything for running each algorithm with the environment into a file where we are able to input which algorithm we are running it for
and then get all results out for it. It makes running the code with all of the different algorithms SUPER easy - woohoo~
It works by setting up the environment, printing out the initial condition and budget (so the same as the OG main)
then it sets up the agent depending on the inputted algorithm, gets the rewards out, plots those rewards, then it gets all the print results we want
and then it also prints out the final condition and budget that I added a little more detail to from the OG once it's done

(4) HOW DO YOU RUN EVERYTHING?
It is super easy and simple now!!! In the if name is main block of main.py, you simply just comment out which line of code you want to run and then all 
the results will be printed out and plotted!
