# CS 138 Programming Assignment 3 - Jane Slagle

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.11.5
- **NumPy**: 2.1.1
- **Jupyter core package requirements**:
  - **IPython**: 8.0.1
  - **ipykernel**: 6.7.0
  - **notebook**: 6.4.8

## To Run
1. After downloading 'FrozenLake.ipynb', run the command 'jupyter notebook' and open up the ipynb file.
2. Run all cell blocks in 'FrozenLake.ipynb' to execute the code.
  - the cell labelled with "Results from running the first algorithm (7.13 + 7.2)" gives the results from running the algorithm with those two equations
  - the cell labelled with "Results from running the second algorithm (7.9 + 7.1)" gives the results from running the algorithm with those two equations
  - the cell labelled with "Results from running SARSA" gives the results from running the SARSA algorithm
